BRKGA for MDVRP

Project Description
This project implements a variant of the BRKGA (Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm) algorithm to solve the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP). The MDVRP is an extension of the classic VRP where multiple depots can dispatch vehicles to satisfy customer demand while respecting capacity and duration constraints.

Key Features
- Structured reading of MDVRP instances from text files.
- Visualization of customers and depots with optional information about demand and time windows.
- Application of an algorithm based on random-key representation to search for feasible solutions.

Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/samuelromeroy/BRKGA-applied-to-MDVRP
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   pip install numpy matplotlib

Quick Start
1. Place the instance file (.txt) in the root directory.
2. Run the notebook BRKGA.ipynb.
3. Adjust the file_path parameter with your instance file name.
4. Run the cells to load data, visualize the instance, and execute the algorithm.

Advanced Configuration
You can modify the algorithm's behavior by adjusting:
- Population size
- Elite and mutant percentages
- Stopping criteria
- Evaluation metrics

These configurations are found in the notebook body.

Hyperparameters
The main BRKGA hyperparameters include:
- population_size: population size
- elite_fraction: fraction of population considered elite
- mutant_fraction: fraction of mutants per generation
- inheritance_prob: probability of inheritance from elite parent
- max_generations: maximum number of generations

Validation
The algorithm is validated graphically through visualization of customers and routes, and quantitatively through the objective function value. Performance can also be compared across different instances.

Results
Routes generated from the found solutions are observed. Solutions are evaluated in terms of total distance traveled and constraint compliance.
